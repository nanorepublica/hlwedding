The wedding breakfast and evening reception are at Downing College, which was Hollyâ€™s college during her PhD studies.  At the evening reception, we will have a live band to dance the night away!

Children are very welcome to attend the ceremony and evening party but the Wedding Breakfast is an adults-only affair, with the exception to those travelling to Cambridge.

The dress code is formal &amp; extra victory points will be awarded for hats or for adding your own flair.
